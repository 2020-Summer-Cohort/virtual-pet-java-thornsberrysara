# Virtual Pet Application

The user begins by adopting a **beautiful** Emu baby. They will give the Emu a name and
promise to take care of them. The user will be in charge of 4 health categories; hunger, thirst,
boredom, and tiredness. Please make sure that you are keeping track of each category. You
don't want your pet to run away! Also, try not to have any categories go over 100. You want a
healthy Emu, not a **chonky** one.
