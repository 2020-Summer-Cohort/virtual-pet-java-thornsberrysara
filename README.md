# Virtual Pet Application

The user begins by adopting a **beautiful** Emu baby. They will give the Emu a name and
promise to take care of them. The user will be in charge of 4 health categories; hunger, thirst,
boredom, and tiredness. Please make sure that you are keeping track of each category. You
don't want your pet to run away! The goal of the game is to keep each category under 100. 
Also, try not to have any categories get to 0. You want a healthy Emu, not a **chonky** one.
